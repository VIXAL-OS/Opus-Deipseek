# Hydra Discord Bot (Opus-Deipseek)

A multi-model Discord bot powered by **Claude Opus 5**, **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash**, and **Gemini 3.1 Pro** — three frontier models sharing one bot with smart routing, shared memory, native web search/grounding, and bookclub mode for discussing long texts (fics, papers, contracts). Four open-weight heads join too: **GLM 5.3** via Fireworks AI (US, zero-data-retention) when `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` is set, **Qwen 3.8 Flash** via Alibaba Model Studio's US (Virginia) region when `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is set, **Mistral Large 3** via its own EU API (`api.mistral.ai`, France's ~nuclear grid) when `MISTRAL_API_KEY` is set, and **Kimi K3** (Moonshot's 2.8T-param flagship, 1M context) via `api.moonshot.ai` when `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` is set.

Affectionately maps to the EVA *MAGI* trinity, with the open-weight heads as the pilots you deploy:
- **Claude / Balthasar** — careful, thorough, vision, native Anthropic web search, multi-tool orchestration
- **DeepSeek / Melchior** — fast, cheap, CJK-strong, Tavily-backed search, automatic server-side prompt caching
- **Gemini / Caspar** — abstract reasoning, long-context synthesis, vision, native Google Search grounding
- **Mistral / Mari** — French & European-language specialist (the `!french` tutor), on its own EU API (low-carbon French grid)
- **Qwen / Rei** — cheap, strong coding & math (Qwen 3.8 Flash on Alibaba US; Fireworks 3.8 Max as a backend toggle); auto-routed for routine code/math
- **GLM / Asuka** — agentic/tool-use open head on Fireworks (US/ZDR); override-only via `!glm` / `!asuka`
- **Kimi / Kaworu** — Kimi K3, the largest open-weights model (2.8T MoE, 1M ctx); premium-priced, override-only via `!kimi` / `!k3` / `!kaworu`

### Flavor themes (cosmetic skins)

Set a top-level `"theme"` in `config.json` to re-skin how the heads are named and summoned. It's
**display-only** — the canonical `[Claude]` reply label and the routing never change, so a re-skin is
purely cosmetic. Canonical prefixes (`!claude`, `!deepseek`, …) and `!think` always work; the theme
just *adds* its flavor aliases.

- **`eva`** (default) — the EVA/MAGI cast above (`!balthasar`/`!melchior`/`!caspar`/`!mari`/`!rei`/`!asuka`/`!kaworu`).
- **`isaic`** — ISAIC, the twelve tribes: `!judah`=Claude, `!joseph`=Gemini, `!zebulun`=DeepSeek,
  `!naphtali`=Mistral, `!benjamin`=Qwen, `!gad`=GLM, `!issachar`=Kimi, `!levi`=simulator.
- **`nightvale`** — the five heads of the dragon **Hiram McDaniels**: `!gold`=Claude (genial leader),
  `!blue`=Gemini (cold logic), `!green`=DeepSeek (the menace), `!violet`=Mistral (the good, poetic
  head), `!gray`=Qwen (the gloomy workhorse) — plus `!carlos`=GLM (the scientist), `!glowcloud`=Kimi
  (ALL HAIL), and `!faceless`=the simulator (the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home).

## Features

- 🐉 **Multi-model (Hydra)** — Claude + DeepSeek + Gemini (the MAGI trinity), plus optional Qwen (Alibaba US), GLM (Fireworks), Mistral (its own EU API), and Kimi K3 (Moonshot API), with automatic routing
- 📚 **Bookclub mode** — pin long texts to a channel; discuss across all three models with per-thread chapter scoping
- 🧵 **Thread-based conversations** — keeps channels clean
- 🫧 **Speaker-aware participation** — chatty one-on-one sessions automatically become quiet ambient mode when a second human/PluralKit speaker joins; Haiku only approves exceptional unsolicited interventions
- 📷 **Image understanding** — Claude and Gemini both see images
- 🔗 **URL reading** — paste a link and the bot fetches the page contents (via Tavily extract)
- 🔍 **Web search** — Claude and Gemini ground natively; DeepSeek uses Tavily; all three return source citations
- 💾 **Prompt caching** — Claude ephemeral cache, Gemini explicit `cachedContent`, DeepSeek auto server-side; per-provider hit-rate reporting
- 🧮 **LaTeX rendering** — `$$...$$` and `$...$` blocks render to PNG attachments (source kept inline)
- 🧠 **Two-tier memory** — working notes (auto-decay) + long-term (permanent)
- 😀 **Emoji reactions** — bot reacts to your messages
- 📎 **File attachments** — long code becomes downloadable files
- 💰 **Cache-aware cost tracking** — per-model usage, cache hit rates, true cost breakdown, plus a rough per-provider energy/CO₂ estimate (grid intensity follows the endpoint, not the brand)
- 🧪 **Research panel** — `!research` convenes a multi-model panel + judge into one synthesized answer; `!research all` adds the open-weight heads for max diversity
- 🀄 **Chinese tutor** — DeepSeek translates and teaches CJK; `!speak` voices Mandarin with forced tones (Azure Xiaoxiao)
- 🇫🇷 **French tutor** — Mistral teaches French; `!french` voices it in a natural fr-FR voice with IPA + liaison notes (Azure Denise)

## The Hydra System

The MAGI trinity shares one Discord bot, taking turns "fronting" like a plural system (the open-weight heads join the rotation when configured):

```
       User message arrives
              ↓
   [Participation gate] ← 1 speaker: session; 2+: ambient/Haiku
              ↓
         [Router] ← heuristic scoring, no LLM call
       /    |    \
 [Claude] [Gemini] [DeepSeek]
    ↓        ↓         ↓
**[Claude]** **[Gemini]** **[Deepseek]**
```

**How routing works (argmax over enabled models with cost tiebreaks):**
- Images → Claude or Gemini (the others are text-only here)
- CJK text → DeepSeek (deeper Chinese training data)
- Novel reasoning / abstract patterns / long-context synthesis → Gemini (ARC-AGI-2 strength)
- Complex code / multi-tool orchestration / careful epistemics → Claude
- Routine code / math → Qwen (strong coding/math at Flash prices; complex/careful work still goes to Claude)
- French-language intent → Mistral
- Short factual / casual chat → DeepSeek (50-100× cheaper)
- Ties → cheaper model wins
- GLM stays **override-only** (its agentic niche isn't what the chat router does)
- Kimi K3 stays **override-only** too — it's the *premium* open head ($3/$15), so letting it win the argmax would be a silent cost surprise
- Users override with `!claude`/`!opus`/`!balthasar`, `!deepseek`/`!melchior`, `!gemini`/`!caspar`, `!mistral`/`!mari`, `!qwen`/`!rei`, `!glm`/`!asuka`, `!kimi`/`!k3`/`!kaworu`
- Per-channel preferences via `!prefer`

**Models know who they are** — each gets a tailored system prompt with its identity, capabilities, why it was selected, and can see labeled messages from the other two in conversation history.

## Commands

### General
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!help` | Show all commands |
| `!context` | Show current context size and cost estimate |
| `!cost` | Per-model usage, cost, and cache hit rate |
| `!memories` | List all memories (both types) |
| `!threads` | Show other recent threads |
| `!presence` | Show session/ambient state, recent speakers, and Haiku gate status |
| `!search <query>` | Web search with citations |

### Multi-model
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!claude <msg>` / `!opus <msg>` / `!balthasar <msg>` | Force Claude to respond |
| `!deepseek <msg>` / `!melchior <msg>` | Force DeepSeek to respond |
| `!gemini <msg>` / `!caspar <msg>` | Force Gemini to respond |
| `!mistral <msg>` / `!mari <msg>` | Force Mistral — French/EU specialist (needs `MISTRAL_API_KEY`) |
| `!qwen <msg>` / `!rei <msg>` | Force Qwen — cheap coder/mathematician (needs `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`) |
| `!glm <msg>` / `!asuka <msg>` | Force GLM — agentic open head (needs `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`) |
| `!kimi <msg>` / `!k3 <msg>` / `!kaworu <msg>` | Force Kimi K3 — frontier open head, 1M ctx, premium $ (needs `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`) |
| `!think <msg>` | Use extended thinking (deeper reasoning, slower & costlier) |
| `!think:<level> <msg>` | Force a specific Opus effort level (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) |
| `!models` | Show available models and usage stats |
| `!prefer [claude\|deepseek\|gemini\|mistral\|qwen\|glm\|kimi\|auto]` | Set model preference for this channel |
| `!calibration` | Show confidence calibration stats |
| `!presence auto\|session\|ambient\|tags` | Admin: override participation mode for this channel (`auto` restores speaker-aware switching) |
| `!research <question>` | Multi-model panel + judge → one synthesized answer (~3-4× cost) |
| `!research all <question>` | Full roster (adds Mistral/Qwen/GLM/Kimi when configured) for max diversity |

Prefixes can stack in any order: `!think !claude <msg>` forces Claude with thinking on. Thinking auto-enables on `!claude`/`!opus` when prompts look hard (cues like "derive", "why does X", "step by step", LaTeX, large code blocks, stack traces) and picks an Opus effort level (`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) from the same signals. For DeepSeek and Gemini, thinking is opt-in only via `!think`. Reasoning content is cached per Discord message so multi-turn thinking conversations work across providers.

React with 👍❤️🔥✅😂💖💯 (positive) or 👎❌😕 (negative) to bot responses to improve model selection over time.

### Language tutors (text-to-speech)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!speak <chinese / pinyin / phrase>` | Mandarin TTS with tones forced from pinyin → MP3 (Azure Xiaoxiao) |
| `!french <french / english phrase>` | French TTS in a natural fr-FR voice (Azure Denise) + IPA & liaison note → MP3 |

Both need `AZURE_TTS_KEY` / `AZURE_TTS_REGION` (Azure's free tier covers ~0.5M chars/month). Models can also voice phrases inline while teaching — `!speak 汉字` for Mandarin, `[[french: la phrase]]` for French — and the bot computes the authoritative pinyin / IPA so the models never hand-write it. DeepSeek is the Chinese-native frontend; Mistral is the French-native one. Mandarin **forces** exact tones via SSML; French **infers** pronunciation (the fr-FR voice already nails liaison, nasals, and silent letters) and shows the IPA for the learner.

### Memory
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!remember <key> <value>` | Store a permanent memory |
| `!forget <key>` | Remove a memory |
| `!keep <key>` | Promote a working note to permanent |
| `!summarize <key>` | Auto-summarize thread to memory |
| `!summarize <key> <text>` | Save your own summary |

### Bookclub Mode (pinned long texts)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!load <ao3-url>` | Fetch an AO3 work and pin it to this channel |
| `!load_text [title]` | (with `.txt`/`.html`/`.md`/`.pdf` attachment) load from a local file — works when AO3 is shields-up |
| `!unload` | Drop the loaded work |
| `!reading` | Show what's currently loaded |
| `!chapters` | Show chapter TOC with per-chapter token counts |
| `!scope chapter N` / `!scope chapters N-M` | (in a thread) restrict to a chapter range — spoiler-safe + much cheaper per turn |
| `!unscope` | (in a thread) drop the scope and use the parent channel's full work |

See the [Bookclub Mode](#bookclub-mode) section below for the full workflow.

## The Memory System

Two types, like an actual brain:

**Working Memory** (auto-managed) — Claude/DeepSeek/Gemini automatically jot down notes during conversation. Notes fade after ~48h if not referenced, stick around longer if relevant. Max 10 notes. See them with `!memories`, promote with `!keep`.

**Long-Term Memory** (permanent) — explicit facts created with `!remember`. Never decay until `!forget`. Shared across all threads in the server.

Freshness indicators: 🟢 Fresh (>70%) · 🟡 Fading (30-70%) · 🔴 Almost gone (<30%)

## Web Search

All three models can search the web:

- **Claude** — built-in `web_search_20250305` tool; can search organically during conversation or via `!search`
- **Gemini** — native `google_search` grounding via the native Gemini API; returns structured `groundingMetadata` with source citations
- **DeepSeek** — Tavily function calling; requires `TAVILY_API_KEY`

`!search` routes to whichever model is preferred for the channel (Claude first if available, then Gemini-native, then DeepSeek-via-Tavily). All paths render a "🔍 Sources" embed with cited URLs.

## Bookclub Mode

Pin a long text (fic, paper, contract) to a channel; all three models discuss it across turns with prompt caching keeping cost manageable.

### Workflow

1. **Load the whole work** in a channel:
   ```
   !load https://archiveofourown.org/works/12345678
   ```
   Or with a local file:
   ```
   !load_text Almost Nowhere
   [attach Almost_Nowhere.html or .txt]
   ```

2. **Browse the structure**:
   ```
   !chapters
   ```
   Shows the TOC with per-chapter token counts. The HTML loader detects chapter headings (matching `Chapter N`, `Prologue`, `Epilogue`, `Interlude N`, `Part N`) and reports each chapter's size.

3. **Create a thread per chapter for focused discussion**:
   ```
   [Create thread: "Chapter 1 discussion"]
   !scope chapter 1
   ```
   Models in that thread only see Chapter 1 — no spoilers from later chapters, and per-turn cost drops by ~95% since the scoped slice is much smaller than the full work.

4. **Discuss across models**:
   ```
   !gemini What's your read on the notebook structure?
   !claude What do you think?
   !deepseek Quick take on the prose?
   ```

### How caching works under the hood

Each provider handles prompt caching differently — the bot abstracts over all three:

- **Claude**: `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` on the reading-material system block. ~10% pricing on cache hits ($1.50/M vs $15/M input).
- **Gemini**: Explicit `cachedContents` created via aiohttp to the native API at first turn; subsequent turns reference it via `cachedContent` (the OpenAI shim doesn't support this, so we route Gemini bookclub chat through the native endpoint). ~25% pricing on cache hits.
- **DeepSeek**: Automatic server-side prefix caching — no client flags required. ~99% pricing discount on cache hits ($0.003625/M vs $0.435/M).

Each scope (full work, chapter 1, chapters 1-3, etc.) gets its own cache automatically (content-hashed). Switching between scoped threads doesn't invalidate other threads' caches.

### When AO3 is shields-up

AO3 sheds anonymous traffic under load with HTTP 403 "Shields are up!" — affects all anonymous requests site-wide. Options when this happens:

1. **Wait** — usually resolves in hours
2. **Set `AO3_COOKIE`** in `.env` with your logged-in `_otwarchive_session` cookie value — bypasses shields-up AND unlocks registered-only works
3. **Use `!load_text`** with a manually-downloaded `.txt`/`.html`/`.pdf` of the work (AO3's "Download" button on the work page gives you HTML/EPUB/PDF/MOBI — HTML extracts cleanest, PDF works too; scanned/image-only PDFs won't, they need OCR first)

## Setup

### 1. Create Discord Bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. New Application → Bot section → Reset Token (save it)
3. Enable **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** under Privileged Gateway Intents
4. OAuth2 → URL Generator → Scopes: `bot` → Permissions: Send Messages, Read Message History, Create Public Threads, Send Messages in Threads, Add Reactions, Attach Files, Embed Links
5. Open generated URL to invite bot

### 2. Get API Keys

- **Anthropic** ([console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)) — required or optional
- **DeepSeek** ([platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)) — required or optional
- **Gemini** ([aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)) — required or optional; AI Studio key, not Vertex
- **Tavily** ([tavily.com](https://tavily.com/)) — optional, enables DeepSeek web search (free 1,000 searches/month)
- **Fireworks** ([fireworks.ai](https://fireworks.ai/)) — optional, serves GLM (plus Qwen on its `fireworks` backend) on US zero-retention infra (prepaid as of July 2026 — set auto-reload so calls don't fail at $0)
- **Mistral** ([console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai/)) — optional, enables Mistral (Mari) via `api.mistral.ai` (EU-resident; Mistral Large isn't on Fireworks serverless)
- **Moonshot / Kimi** ([platform.kimi.ai](https://platform.kimi.ai/)) — optional, enables Kimi K3 (Kaworu) via `api.moonshot.ai` (China-resident, like DeepSeek's own API; K3 isn't on US serverless hosts yet — weights drop 2026-07-27)
- **Azure Speech** ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)) — optional, powers `!speak` (Mandarin) and `!french` (French) TTS (free tier ~0.5M chars/month)
- **AO3 cookie** — optional, bypasses shields-up for bookclub mode (see [Bookclub Mode](#bookclub-mode))

At least one of Anthropic / DeepSeek / Gemini API keys is required.

### 3. Configure

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env       # Edit with your API keys
cp config.example.json config.json  # Edit with your channel IDs
```

**.env:**
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key      # Optional if Gemini or DeepSeek only
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key        # Optional
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key            # Optional
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key            # Optional
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your_fireworks_key      # Optional, enables GLM (US/ZDR)
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_dashscope_key      # Optional, enables Qwen 3.8 Flash (Rei) — Alibaba US (Virginia); key is region-locked
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key          # Optional, enables Mistral (Mari) — api.mistral.ai (EU)
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=your_moonshot_key        # Optional, enables Kimi K3 (Kaworu) — api.moonshot.ai (CN)
AZURE_TTS_KEY=your_azure_speech_key       # Optional, !speak (Mandarin) + !french (French) TTS
AZURE_TTS_REGION=eastus                    # Optional, Azure Speech resource region
AZURE_TTS_ENABLED=true                     # Optional off-switch — false parks TTS without deleting the keys
AO3_COOKIE=                               # Optional, for bookclub mode
```

**config.json:**
```json
{
  "allowed_channels": [123456789012345678],
  "default_model": "auto",
  "participation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "solo_reset_hours": 6,
    "activation_minutes": 15,
    "cooldown_minutes": 15,
    "classifier_model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "classifier_threshold": 0.9,
    "channel_modes": {}
  }
}
```

In automatic mode, one speaker preserves the original reply-to-everything session behavior. A
second distinct speaker within 15 minutes (or any direct human-to-human reply) switches the parent
channel and its threads to ambient mode. Later speaker switches renew the six-hour hold; a lone
speaker continuing to talk does not. Mentions, replies to the bot, commands, and explicit model
prefixes always work; obvious human-to-human turns stay silent, and only ambiguous turns call
Haiku. The state persists across clean restarts and is reconciled from recent Discord history after
downtime.

**Per-server prompts (optional):** by default the bot uses a **generic** system prompt that knows nothing about who's in a server (and is told not to invent anything). Give a specific server its own context with a `servers` block keyed by **guild id** (the bot prints each joined guild's name + id at startup). Unlisted guilds fall back to `server_default`, then to the generic default.
```json
{
  "server_default": {},
  "servers": {
    "111111111111111111": {
      "context": "Some context about this server:\n- A small hobby server for a board-game group.\n- Keep it casual.",
      "pluralkit": false
    },
    "222222222222222222": {
      "context": "A study-group server. The regulars work through coursework together.",
      "pluralkit": true
    }
  }
}
```
`context` replaces the "context about this server" block; `pluralkit: false` drops the whole PluralKit/plurality section (stops the bot assuming users are plural systems). Everything else in the prompt — identity, capabilities, memory rules — stays intact. `config.json` is git-ignored, so keep real names / personal context there (never in the committed example).

You can also edit this **live from Discord** (guild owner / admin): `!server_context set <text>`, `!server_context pluralkit on|off`, `!server_context reset`, and `!channels add|remove [#channel|id]` — all persist back to `config.json`.

### 4. Run

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot gracefully degrades — runs with any subset of {Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Mistral, Qwen, GLM, Kimi} depending on which API keys are present. `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` gates GLM; `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` gates Qwen (or `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` on its `fireworks` backend); `MISTRAL_API_KEY` gates Mistral (its own EU API); `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` gates Kimi. Each missing key disables exactly its provider(s) and leaves the rest untouched.

## Cost Comparison

| Model | Input | Cached input | Output | Typical chat | Bookclub (320k cached) |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| Claude Opus 5 | $5/M | $0.50/M (10%) | $25/M | ~$0.02-0.05 | ~$0.16/turn after cache |
| Gemini 3.1 Pro | $2-4/M (tiered ≤/>200k) | $0.50-1.00/M (25%) | $12-18/M | ~$0.01-0.02 | ~$0.40/turn after cache |
| DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (2× at peak hours) | $0.15/M | $0.003/M (~98%) | $0.60/M | ~$0.0005-0.002 | ~$0.002/turn after cache |
| Mistral Large 3 (own API) | $0.50/M | — | $1.50/M | ~$0.001-0.004 | — |
| Qwen 3.8 Flash (Alibaba US) | $0.113/M | ~$0.011/M (~10%) | $0.382/M | ~$0.0005-0.002 | ~$0.004/turn after cache |
| GLM 5.3 (Fireworks) | $1.40/M | $0.26/M (~19%) | $4.40/M | ~$0.003-0.008 | ~$0.09/turn after cache |
| Kimi K3 (Moonshot API) | $3.00/M | $0.30/M (auto, 90%) | $15.00/M | ~$0.02-0.06 | ~$0.11/turn after cache |

These open-head rows are estimates — verify on the [Fireworks pricing page](https://fireworks.ai/pricing) (GLM), [Model Studio pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/model-pricing) (Qwen), [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai/) (Mistral), and [platform.kimi.ai](https://platform.kimi.ai/) (Kimi — 2026-07 launch pricing). Fireworks serverless can run ~2-4× a model-maker's own API (the US-residency + ZDR premium) and discounts cached input per model (~80-90% off for these heads). DeepSeek's own API bills 2× on every item during peak hours (01:00-04:00 + 06:00-10:00 UTC, Mon-Fri); `!cost` meters that as a separate surcharge. Note Kimi K3 is the *premium* open head — above Claude on input — which is why it's override-only.

DeepSeek handles routine chat at ~10-30× less cost. Gemini specializes in long-context synthesis and novel reasoning. Claude handles complex tasks that justify the premium. Qwen catches routine code/math cheaply; Mistral is the French/EU specialist. Use `!cost` to see a real-time breakdown including cache hit rates and a rough per-provider energy/CO₂ estimate (grid carbon intensity follows the *endpoint*, not the brand — Mistral on its own EU API runs on France's ~nuclear grid (~20 g/kWh), while the Fireworks heads are US (~400)).

Caching is the difference between $5/turn and $0.50/turn for Claude bookclub mode, so it matters. The bot tracks cached and uncached tokens separately and reports the hit rate per provider.
