# AGENTS.md — Hydra (Opus-Deipseek)

Single-file (`bot.py`) multi-model Discord bot. EVA/MAGI-themed heuristic router over
**Codex (Balthasar) · DeepSeek (Melchior) · Gemini (Caspar)** plus open-weight heads
**Qwen (Rei) · GLM (Asuka)** on Fireworks and **Mistral (Mari)** on its own EU API. Two-tier memory,
prompt caching, bookclub mode, Mandarin (`!speak`) + French (`!french`) TTS,
research panel (`!research`), simulator mode (`!dummy` — base-model transcript completion),
and cost + carbon tracking.

This file is the working status + remaining-work tracker for the "Hydra Restructure"
spec. The full spec lives outside the repo (Sarah's Codex.ai artifact); this file is
self-contained — you don't need it to pick up the remaining work below.

## Run / verify
- `python bot.py` — needs `.env` (`DISCORD_TOKEN` + ≥1 model key) and `config.json`
  (`allowed_channels`, `default_model`).
- Syntax gate (no deps): `python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('bot.py',encoding='utf-8').read())"`
- Import/logic test: `python -c "import bot"` works (deps installed). On Windows console
  prefix `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` when printing bot output (emoji/CJK/IPA).

## Editing rules (load-bearing — read before touching bot.py)
- **Graceful degradation:** a missing API key disables ONLY that provider. The gating key follows
  the *active backend* (`provider.api_key_env`): by default `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` gates Qwen+GLM
  together and **Mistral has its own `MISTRAL_API_KEY`** (`api.mistral.ai`) — its flagship (Large 3)
  is on-demand-only on Fireworks, not serverless. `self_hosted`/`vertex` backends have no key and aren't
  key-gated (operator owns the local server / GCP ADC). Absent keys disable exactly those providers.
- **Config-driven registry (Phase 0).** `ProviderRegistry.from_config()` (built once in `__init__`
  from `config.json`'s optional `providers` block) wires every provider's client + backend. The 6
  `ModelProvider(...)` constants are the code-side default spec (pricing/energy/quirks +
  `sdk_type`/`api_key_env`/`base_url`/`backend`/`backends`); config supplies operator overrides
  (`enabled`/`backend`/`model`/`routing_tags`) + the `platform` toggle. **No `providers` block ⇒
  byte-for-byte the old behavior.** `routing_tags` is present but INERT (routing stays in
  `_estimate_confidence`).
- **`provider.name` is the canonical routing key.** `_select_model`, `_estimate_confidence`,
  `panel_members`, cost, and persistence all branch on it. NEVER rename it. (`provider.id` — the
  lowercase config key — is separate; it keys `config.json` + `self.clients`.) Display names and
  command aliases are a separate theme layer on top (see naming below).
- **Dispatch** routes on `provider.sdk_type` (`anthropic` | `openai_compatible` | `gemini`), set by
  the registry. Codex → anthropic SDK; Gemini bookclub → native `cachedContents` (or Vertex
  `CachedContent` when `backend="vertex"`); everything else → the OpenAI-compatible shim
  (`_generate_openai_compatible_response`) via `self.clients[provider.id]`. Per-provider wiring lives
  in the registry, not `__init__`.
- **Model slugs drift** — verify in the live libraries. Fireworks (verified 2026-09-21):
  `glm-5p3`, `qwen3p8-max`, `deepseek-v4p1-flash` (under `accounts/fireworks/models/`); Qwen's
  default is now `qwen3.8-flash` on Alibaba US and DeepSeek's is `deepseek-flash` (see CLAUDE.md). Mistral on
  its own API uses `mistral-large-latest` (→ Mistral Large 3, released 2025-12, 675B/41B MoE,
  Apache-2.0; priced $0.50/$1.50 per Mtok as of 2026-06 — a ~4× drop from Large 2). ⚠️ Large 3 is
  on Fireworks only as **on-demand/dedicated** (`mistral-large-3-fp8`), NOT serverless — so the
  own-API route stays correct AND is now the cheap one, not just the green one.
- New-provider **pricing + energy constants are estimates** flagged `VERIFY` in comments —
  confirm against the Fireworks pricing page before trusting `!cost` $ figures.

## Naming theme — now a toggleable **theme layer** (`config.json` top-level `"theme"`)
Themes are a **display-only skin**: `Flavor`/`Theme`/`THEMES` (just after `SIM_PROVIDER`) map each
`provider.id` → themed display name + command aliases + a persona note. Read in
`ProviderRegistry.from_config` (mirrors the `platform` toggle), applied onto `provider.display_name`
and the `self.alias_to_flag` map built in `__init__`. **The canonical `provider.name`, the
`**[Codex]**` label, and `MODEL_LABEL_NAMES` never change** — a Judah/Gold-Head turn is still
labeled `[Codex]` on the wire. Canonical bare prefixes (`!Codex`/`!deepseek`/…) + `!think` work in
every theme; the theme only *adds* its flavor aliases. Three sets ship (default **`eva`** ⇒
byte-for-byte the old behavior):
- **`eva` — EVA/MAGI** (default). Trinity Balthasar/Melchior/Caspar; pilots Mistral=Mari (`!mari`),
  Qwen=Rei (`!rei`), GLM=Asuka (`!asuka`); sim=Dummy Plug (`!dummy`).
- **`isaic` — ISAIC** ("International System of AI Coopertition"), the twelve tribes: Judah=Codex
  (`!judah`), Joseph=Gemini (`!joseph`), Zebulun=DeepSeek (`!zebulun`), Naphtali=Mistral
  (`!naphtali`), Benjamin=Qwen (`!benjamin`), Gad=GLM (`!gad`), Levi=sim (`!levi`). **Now in code**
  (was docs-only); it's also the Slack bot's default skin (Phase 4).
- **`nightvale` — the five heads of Hiram McDaniels** (+ residents): Gold=Codex (`!gold`),
  Blue=Gemini (`!blue`), Green=DeepSeek (`!green`), Violet=Mistral (`!violet`/`!purple`), Gray=Qwen
  (`!gray`/`!grey`); plus Carlos=GLM (`!carlos`) and the Faceless Old Woman=sim (`!faceless`).

## Status — 2026-08-08

### ✅ Speaker-aware session → ambient participation gate (2026-08-08)
The bot no longer commissions a model reply for every eligible human message. A channel-level social
gate now runs **before** `_ensure_thread()` / typing / generation:
- **Automatic two-clock state:** one speaker keeps the old chatty `session` behavior. A second
  distinct speaker within 15 minutes — or any explicit human→human Discord reply — switches the
  parent channel and its threads to `ambient`. Later speaker switches renew a 6h hold; continued
  turns from the same lone speaker do **not**, so session mode returns after 6h without multi-speaker
  evidence. Normal users key by Discord id; webhook/PluralKit speakers key by webhook id + normalized
  display name, so separate proxied members count as separate conversational voices.
- **Structural invitations always pass:** bot mentions, replies to the bot, commands, and stacked
  model/`!think` prefixes bypass the quiet gate. Replies to another human and obvious short
  acknowledgements close deterministically. Genuine bot accounts are ignored; webhook proxies remain
  human turns.
- **Haiku only sees ambiguous ambient turns.** `claude-haiku-4-5` gets the latest 12 local turns and
  returns `{action, intervention_value, reason}`; reply threshold defaults to 0.90, false positives are
  explicitly costed 5× worse than silence, and API/parse failures fail closed. One unsolicited reply
  per 15m max; concurrent decisions serialize and are dropped if the conversation advances while
  Haiku is deciding. No suppressed turn creates a thread or typing indicator.
- **Reboot-safe + configurable:** state persists under `_participation_states` in `memories.json` and
  lazily merges the previous hold window from the parent plus recent active/archived thread histories
  after restart. `config.json`'s optional `participation` block controls activation/hold/cooldown/model/
  threshold/history, and `!presence auto|session|ambient|tags` provides persisted admin overrides plus
  live state/status. No config block ⇒ the new automatic defaults.
- **Honest accounting:** classifier calls use a non-routing `Haiku participation gate` pseudo-provider,
  separately persisted and shown in `!cost` at Haiku pricing; it can never enter `_select_model`.
- Offline-validated: `scratchpad/test_participation_gate.py` (**38/38**), existing panel (**31/31**),
  Kimi/provider (**28/28**), PDF (**16/16**), syntax/import/config gates all pass. A synthetic live
  `claude-haiku-4-5` round-trip also passed (correct SILENT verdict + real usage counters). ⚠️ Owes one
  live **Discord** smoke test: second speaker triggers ambient before their first turn, and
  `!presence`/`!cost` reflect the transition and classifier call.

### ✅ `!research` panel: Gemini `thought_signature` 400 + DeepSeek tool-call dump (2026-07-10)
Two failures, both in the **shared tool loop** of `_generate_openai_compatible_response` — which
Gemini uses more than you'd think: `_panel_complete` routes everything non-Codex through the shim,
and `_generate_response` only picks the native Gemini path when reading material is loaded or
`backend="vertex"`. **Plain `!gemini` chat goes through the shim too.**
- **Gemini 400 "Function call is missing a thought_signature" (fixed).** Gemini 3 thinking models
  attach an encrypted per-call signature and reject the FOLLOW-UP request unless it's echoed back
  verbatim. Over the OpenAI shim it rides at `tool_calls[i].extra_content.google.thought_signature`;
  the loop rebuilt the assistant turn keeping only `{id,type,function}` and dropped it. So *any*
  Gemini turn that tool-called died on the second request — every `!research`, and every `!gemini`
  chat that decided to search. Bookclub was immune (native path). Now `_tool_call_extra_content()`
  reads it (typed attr → `model_dump()` → nested pydantic) and the rebuild echoes it back per call,
  never synthesizing one for a call that had none. ⚠️ Lowering `thinking_level`/`reasoning_effort`
  does NOT lift the requirement — don't "fix" it that way. Fallback if the shim ever returns no
  `extra_content`: stop attaching `web_search` to Gemini (it has native `google_search` grounding
  via `_search_for`). The outer `except` now prints that hint when it sees the string.
- **DeepSeek "no actual content (only unexecuted tool calls)" (fixed).** Live DeepSeek V4-Pro server
  bug (`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3` issue #1244, open, ~2/19 completions): it serializes the call into
  `content` (`finish_reason="stop"`, `tool_calls=null`). Non-empty ⇒ sailed past
  `_is_provider_error`, counted as a surviving panelist, and reached the judge as an "answer". New
  `_looks_like_tool_call_dump()` catches the chat-template tokens (`<|tool▁…|>`, U+2581) / a tool
  name welded onto a JSON object / a whole-message tool-call object, deliberately high-precision so
  prose *about* `web_search` or JSON doesn't trip it. On detection (or on an empty completion) it
  retries once and, if still degraded, returns a real `Deepseek Error:` sentinel so the panel DROPS
  the member. The forced-text retry now **drops the `tools` array** instead of setting
  `tool_choice="none"` — a model that already decided to call a tool verbalizes the call when merely
  forbidden from emitting it. A blank with *no* tool intent keeps its tools (that retry is a re-roll).
- **Latent tool-loop bug also fixed:** only `web_search` calls got a `tool` reply, so any other tool
  name left a dangling `tool_call` id → malformed follow-up → 400. Every id now gets exactly one reply.
- **Panel/judge hardening:** `_run_panel` returns `(survivors, failures)` and logs the **full** error
  (the old `text[:120]` truncation is what hid this outage); the footer **names** failed members
  instead of `1 member(s) failed`; the judge's own output is now checked with `_is_provider_error`
  and a judge failure falls back to posting the raw panel answers instead of publishing
  `Codex Error 529: overloaded` as the synthesis; `_panel_complete` finally forwards `thinking=` on
  the openai path; the cost multiplier counts members *attempted*, not survivors.
- Offline-validated: `scratchpad/test_panel_fixes.py` (31/31 — true positives, false-positive guards,
  signature round-trip incl. `_strip_internal_keys` + JSON serialization); syntax + import gates pass.
  ⚠️ **Owes two live smoke tests:** (1) `!research` → Gemini survives a `web_search` round-trip;
  (2) grep the 7/9 logs for `⚠️ Deepseek returned empty content` — if that line is ABSENT, #1244 (not
  our own retry) was the cause, which is what the evidence says.

### ✅ Gemini bookclub cache — inline by default + real cost accounting (2026-07-08)
Root-caused a recurring Gemini prepay depletion (a persistent 452k-token bookclub cache). Fixes,
all offline-validated (`scratchpad/test_cache_fixes.py`, 20/20; import/syntax gates pass):
- **Inline is now the DEFAULT for Gemini bookclub.** `self.gemini_explicit_cache` (init in `__init__`
  from `providers.gemini.explicit_cache`, default **False**) gates BOTH `_ensure_gemini_cache` (native)
  and `_ensure_gemini_vertex_cache`. Off ⇒ the fic is inlined each turn (existing no-cache branch) and
  Google's **implicit** caching gives the read discount with **no per-hour storage bill** — no
  cachedContents to create/refresh/leak/`!uncache`. This CHANGES the old default (was explicit
  caching). Explicit stays fully intact behind the toggle. **`!explicitcache on|off`** (admin, persists
  via `_save_config`) flips it — `on` for a sustained back-to-back marathon (guaranteed discount, bills
  ~$0.45/hr storage for the 452k fic), `off` returns to inline AND drops any live cache. Startup prints
  the active mode.
- **Timezone bug fixed.** Cache expiry math mixed naive-UTC (`expireTime`, tzinfo stripped) with
  naive-LOCAL `datetime.now()` — on the UTC−4 host this made the code think a Google-expired cache was
  alive ~4h longer (dead-zone of full-price inline re-uploads; the sliding refresh also never fired).
  Now ONE aware-UTC clock: `_utcnow()` / `_as_utc()` everywhere in the cache path; `from_dict` coerces
  old (naive/mixed) persisted timestamps so nothing raises offset-naive-vs-aware.
- **`!cost` no longer under-reports storage.** Was a one-shot creation-time estimate (one 6h TTL,
  frozen) — a cache alive for days still showed ~$2.71. Now metered by REAL lifetime: `cache_created_at`
  per handle; live caches accrue on the fly in `get_cost_summary` (created→now, capped at expiry) and
  settle into `total_cache_storage_cost_est` at teardown (`_settle_gemini_storage`, idempotent, no
  double-count). `_gemini_storage_cost` is the shared helper.
- **`!uncache` no longer lies.** `_delete_gemini_cache` now returns success ONLY when actually gone
  (200/204/404, or a 403 whose body says "not found"); a bare billing/permission 403 → failure.
  `_drop_gemini_cache` deletes BEFORE clearing the handle and KEEPS it on failure (returns
  `(attempted, deleted)`), so a still-billing cache stays targetable instead of being orphaned.
  `!uncache` reports the real count and warns when a delete couldn't be confirmed.
- ⚠️ **Owes one live smoke test:** confirm Gemini implicit caching actually discounts a 452k prefix on
  `gemini-3.1-pro` (once the balance is topped up) — inline's whole premise. Worst case (no implicit
  hit) is ~$1.81/turn full input but still **no storage bleed**. Also verify `!explicitcache on` still
  creates/refreshes/deletes cleanly end-to-end.

### ✅ `!research` judge now verifies instead of dismissing post-cutoff facts (2026-07-08)
The Codex judge (`_judge`) was called with `claude_tools=[]` (web search **off** — "synthesise from
answers given") and a prompt telling it to "flag claims that look unsupported", with no cutoff
awareness. Result: real products released after its training cutoff (e.g. a June-2026 model) looked
"unsupported" → it declared them fabricated ("confirmed vapor") with false confidence. Fix:
- **Judge keeps web search** — dropped the `claude_tools=[]` (now defaults to the `web_search` tool),
  so it can VERIFY decision-critical / post-cutoff claims before ruling (selectively, not re-research).
- **Rewrote the judge system prompt** with an EPISTEMICS block: states today's date; "absence from
  memory is NOT evidence something is fake"; search to verify named products/versions/prices/dates/
  events that could postdate the cutoff; calibrated verdicts (CONFIRMED / CONTRADICTED / UNVERIFIED);
  NEVER say "fabricated/vapor" unless search *actively* contradicts it.
- **Judge now runs with `thinking=True`** (threaded through `_panel_complete`) — adjudicating conflicts
  + deciding what to verify is real reasoning, not a formatting pass. Other `_panel_complete` callers
  keep `thinking=False`.
- **Panel-member prompt** hardened against citation fabrication: URLs/quotes/dates/hashes may be cited
  ONLY from an actual `web_search` result in-conversation, never invented/reconstructed from memory; if
  it didn't search, attach no citations and flag the claim as from-memory. (DeepSeek *is* offered the
  Tavily `web_search` tool in the panel but chose not to call it, then fabricated URLs+hashes to satisfy
  "cite sources" — this is the source-side fix; the searching judge is the downstream catch.)
- **Empty-completion robustness** in `_generate_openai_compatible_response`: an empty `content` used to
  surface as a silent `''` → a dropped panel member with no retry (why a first `!research` could lose
  DeepSeek while the next worked). Now it logs `finish_reason` + `pending_tool_calls` and retries once
  (forcing `tool_choice="none"` if the 3-round tool cap was hit) — self-heals a transient blank and
  makes a persistent one diagnosable.
- Syntax/import gates pass. ⚠️ Owes a live smoke test (the exact failure query, once credits are up).

### ✅ Built (validated offline, needs live-key smoke tests)
- **Phase 7 — simulator mode, rung 1 (2026-06-27).** The **Dummy Plug** (`!dummy`/`!sim`): a base
  model continues the channel as an IRC/script transcript via `/completions` instead of chatting.
  `ModelProvider.completions_mode` + `sim_sampler` (§9.1/9.3); `_format_transcript` /
  `_parse_transcript_turn` / `_generate_simulator_response` (one dispatch branch ahead of the
  `sdk_type` cases); cost **and** carbon ride the same `record_usage` path as the chat heads (§9.2).
  Config-driven (`providers.sim.{enabled,base_url,model,api_key_env,sampler,search}`); **off by
  default** and **override-only** (excluded from the argmax; reachable via `!dummy` or `!prefer sim`
  — the spec's "designated channel"). Behavior-preserving on the default config (46-check offline
  harness + adversarial multi-agent review, findings folded in). **Scope (Sarah's call):** rung 1
  only — rungs 2–3 (ambient turn-taking, webhook personas; "the loom") were deliberately NOT built,
  and simulator mode is intentionally kept out of Phase 4 / lab planning. ⚠️ Owes one live smoke
  test against a real base endpoint.
  - **Query-driven search grounding (§9.2/§9.5, wired 2026-06-27).** A base model can't tool-call,
    so `_generate_simulator_response` now detects a search intent in the latest user turn
    (`_sim_search_query`: explicit `[search: …]` directive or a leading-question/lookup-cue
    heuristic) and **prepends** `_search_for(provider, query).text` to the transcript preamble —
    the sim analogue of the chat heads' tool-result append. **Off by default** (`sim_search`,
    flip via `providers.sim.search=true`) and gated on a real backend being available
    (`_search_backend_available`), so the default Dummy Plug never auto-searches. `SIM_PROVIDER`'s
    `search_backend` is back to `"tavily"`. Pasted-URL grounding still folds in regardless via
    `_augment_with_url_extracts`. Offline-validated (31-check `test_sim_search.py`).
- **Phases 0 + 2 + 3 — registry + Gemini Vertex + DeepSeek/Mistral backend toggles (2026-06-24).**
  Config-driven `ProviderRegistry` (`sdk_type` dispatch; `config.json` `providers`+`platform`),
  behavior-preserving on the default config (24-check offline harness passes). Gemini `vertex`
  backend + DeepSeek `fireworks`/`self_hosted` + Mistral `together`/`self_hosted` are code-complete
  with a `local` cost mode; the non-default backends ⚠️ owe live smoke tests. See the table +
  per-phase sections above.
- **Bookclub Gemini cache cost controls (2026-06-24).** Context-cache storage bills per token-hour
  for the whole TTL (~$11.6 for a 452k-token fic at the old fixed 24h), so: TTL is now a **6h
  sliding window** (`GEMINI_CACHE_TTL_HOURS` env knob; `_refresh_gemini_cache` PATCHes the expiry
  forward once past halfway → active discussion never expires mid-conversation, idle dies ~6h after
  last use), and **`!uncache`** drops just the Gemini cache while keeping the book loaded for all
  models (vs `!unload`, which removes the shared `ReadingMaterial` for everyone). Idle caches also
  self-expire, so day-to-day neither is needed.
- **Phase 1 — Qwen/GLM on Fireworks, Mistral on `api.mistral.ai`.** Qwen+GLM share one
  Fireworks key (cached input = 0.5×input); Mistral is on its own EU API (`MISTRAL_API_KEY`)
  because Mistral Large 3 isn't on Fireworks serverless — a happy accident: EU-resident + France
  ~nuclear grid (grid≈20 in `!cost`). Graceful degradation, EVA aliases, per-provider personas,
  in `!cost` and the `!research all` panel.
- **Routing — intentional deviation from the spec.** The spec said new heads "override-only."
  Per Sarah's call that cheap models should earn routing: **Qwen is in the auto-router as the
  cheap coder/mathematician** (wins routine code/math, hands complex/careful work back to
  Codex), **Mistral gets a narrow French-intent nudge**, **GLM stays override-only**.
  ⚠️ Do NOT "fix" this back to all-override-only — it's deliberate.
- **Beyond the spec (Sarah's additions):**
  - `!research all` — opt-in 6-model panel (plain `!research` stays the lean core trio).
  - **Energy/CO₂ in `!cost`** — per-provider Wh (`est_wh_per_1k_tokens`) × per-provider grid
    intensity (`grid_gco2_per_kwh`, follows the *endpoint* not the brand), plus a separate
    amortized-training line (`train_tco2e` over `MODEL_LIFETIME_TOKENS`). Env knobs:
    `GRID_GCO2_PER_KWH`, `MODEL_LIFETIME_TOKENS`, `AMORTIZE_TRAINING`. All flagged
    order-of-magnitude; never used for routing.
  - **`!french` tutor** — inverse of the Mandarin path: Azure `fr-FR-DeniseNeural`, Mistral-native
    G2P returning text+IPA+liaison note, IPA is display-only (no forced phonemes — Azure infers),
    inline `[[french:..]]` for models. Shares Azure config with `!speak`.
  - **Per-server system prompts (config.json `servers`, keyed by guild id) + runtime editors.** The
    system-prompt template has two placeholders filled per guild in `_build_system_prompt(...,
    guild_id=)`: `{server_context}` (the "context about this server" block) and `{plurality_section}`
    (the whole PluralKit block, dropped when a server sets `pluralkit: false`). Lookup order:
    `servers[<guild_id>]` → `server_default` → the `BotConfig` defaults. **The committed
    `default_server_context` is now GENERIC** — it tells the model it knows nothing about who's
    there and must not invent facts (secrets hygiene: no real names/servers in the repo; personal
    context lives only in git-ignored config.json or is set at runtime). `default_plurality_section`
    default is still `pluralkit=true`. The tidy-spacing `re.sub` runs whenever a guild deviates from
    the default. Config entries are validated/normalized by `_coerce_server_cfg` (non-dict → `{}` +
    warn; a quoted `"pluralkit"` → real bool + warn) so a config typo warns at startup instead of
    crashing `_build_system_prompt` on every message and silently muting the guild. `{server_context}`
    is substituted LAST so a custom context can't re-expand a placeholder token. `on_ready` prints
    each joined guild's name+id. **Runtime editors** (`!channels`, `!server_context`; admin/owner-only
    via `_can_edit_config`) mutate the in-memory state AND persist through `_save_config()`, which
    re-dumps `self._raw_config` to config.json (git-ignored) preserving all other keys — so a Discord
    edit and a hand-edit stay in sync. Rationale: the *old* prompt hardcoded "Sarah's projects /
    neuroscience / distributed databases" + an always-on PluralKit section, which made the bot invent
    plural-alter histories on servers that don't use PluralKit.
  - **Working-note extraction hardened.** All 5 generators + both web-search paths now call one
    `_extract_notes(text, guild_id)` helper (compiled `_NOTE_RE`, **case-insensitive** so
    `[Note:]`/`[NOTE:]` are caught, idempotent so it doubles as a safety net). Fixes a real leak:
    `_web_search` (Codex native) and the grounded-Gemini `!search` branch returned model text
    straight to Discord WITHOUT stripping `[note:]`, so a note tacked onto a `!search` answer leaked
    into the message.

### Remaining from the restructure spec
| Phase | Status | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Provider registry refactor (`sdk_type`, config-driven) | ✅ **done** — `ProviderRegistry`, config `providers`+`platform`, `sdk_type` dispatch (behavior-preserving; offline-validated) | — |
| 1 — Mistral/Qwen/GLM on Fireworks | ✅ done (with routing deviation) | — |
| 2 — Gemini Developer-API default | ✅ already the default (operator: keep billing on) | — |
| 2 — Gemini **Vertex** backend | ✅ **code-complete** — `_generate_gemini_vertex_response` + `_ensure_gemini_vertex_cache` + backend-tagged caches; ⚠️ UNVERIFIED (needs GCP ADC) | Optional / lab-only |
| 3 — Provider backend toggles: DeepSeek (`api`/`fireworks`/`self_hosted`) **+ Mistral** (`api`/`together`/`self_hosted`) | ✅ **code-complete** — toggles in registry + `local` cost mode; `api` modes live, `fireworks`/`self_hosted`/`together` ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Med — lab route |

| 7 — Simulator mode (§9, rung 1: transcript completion) | ✅ **code-complete** — Dummy Plug (`!dummy`/`!sim`), config-driven, override-only, cost+carbon tracked (offline-validated, 46-check harness); ⚠️ owes a live smoke test against a real `/completions` endpoint. Rungs 2–3 (ambient/personas) intentionally NOT built. | Done (fun) |

#### Phase 0 — Provider registry refactor — *✅ done (this session)*
`ProviderRegistry.from_config()` (right after the provider constants in `bot.py`) builds every
provider's client + backend from `config.json`. The 6 `ModelProvider(...)` constants stay as the
code-side default spec (pricing/energy/quirks + `sdk_type`/`api_key_env`/`base_url`/`backend`/
`backends`); config's optional `providers` block overrides `enabled`/`backend`/`model`/
`routing_tags`, and a top-level `platform` field is read+stored (Slack is Phase 4). **Hybrid by
design** — the richly-commented constants did NOT move into JSON; config is operator overrides only.
**No `providers` block ⇒ byte-for-byte the old behavior** (offline-validated: enabled set, dispatch,
cost, routing all unchanged). `__init__` is slimmed to bind registry results (`self.providers`,
`self.<id>_provider`, `self.clients`, `self.openai_compatible_clients`); dispatch switches on
`provider.sdk_type`; `pref_map`/`!prefer` are registry-built (so `!prefer qwen|glm|mistral` now work
— the one intentional additive change). `routing_tags` exists but is INERT. Package split deferred
to Phase 4.

#### Phase 2 (Vertex) — *✅ code-complete, ⚠️ unverified (this session)*
Developer API stays the default + no-train **as long as billing stays enabled on the Google project**
(operator setting — Sarah is paying). `gemini.backend = "vertex"` now routes to
`_generate_gemini_vertex_response()` + `_ensure_gemini_vertex_cache()` (lazy `vertexai` import;
`google-cloud-aiplatform` is an OPTIONAL, commented dep). **Cache handles are backend-tagged**
(`Gemini:developer_api` vs `Gemini:vertex` via `_gemini_cache_key()`) so a `cachedContents` id is
never reused against Vertex `CachedContent`; `_drop`/`_reconcile` handle both + the legacy untagged
key. ⚠️ **OWES A LIVE SMOKE TEST** — needs GCP ADC (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) +
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`; the exact vertexai SDK surface (grounding ctor, `from_cached_content`) may
need a tweak per SDK version. `_reconcile_gemini_caches` still sweeps only developer-API caches
(Vertex orphans rely on the per-teardown drop — `TODO(vertex-reconcile)`).

#### Phase 3 — Provider backend toggles (DeepSeek + Mistral) — *✅ code-complete, ⚠️ unverified*
Both toggles are built in the registry (`backends` tables on the constants; selected via
`providers.<id>.backend`). `api` modes are live + unchanged; `fireworks`/`together`/`self_hosted`
are wired but ⚠️ **OWE LIVE SMOKE TESTS** (Fireworks/Together keys, a local vLLM). `self_hosted`
sets `cost_mode="local"` + `supports_server_cache=False` → `get_cost()` returns $0 and `!cost`
labels the line "local (electricity only)" while still showing the 🌱 energy/CO₂ (tokens counted on
the self-host grid). DeepSeek still defaults to its China `api` for the Discord bot (locked
deviation). The per-backend reference below still applies (values flagged `VERIFY` are estimates):

**DeepSeek** stays on its China `api` for the Discord bot (Sarah's call — cheap, and "the Chinese can
have the shitposts"). To add the toggle: `providers.deepseek.backend = api | fireworks | self_hosted`.
- `fireworks` → `accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-pro`, shares `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, keep
  per-token cost at Fireworks rates (~1.74/3.48), server cache at 50%. Update its
  `grid_gco2_per_kwh` to ~400 (US) when on this backend.
- `self_hosted` → local vLLM/Ollama base_url; set `supports_server_cache=False`; add a `local`
  cost mode in `_record_*_usage()` (skip per-token $, label the turn `local`); V4-Flash or 4-bit
  for single-GPU.

**Mistral** is hardcoded to `api.mistral.ai` (set up this way because Mistral Large 3 isn't on
Fireworks *serverless* — `mistral-large-3-fp8` is on-demand/dedicated only). Same
toggle shape: `providers.mistral.backend = api | together | self_hosted`.
- `api` (current) → `api.mistral.ai`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, model `mistral-large-latest` (→ Large 3,
  $0.50/$1.50 per Mtok as of 2026-06). EU-resident + France ~nuclear grid (`grid_gco2_per_kwh=20`).
  **Best default for the Discord bot — keep it** (now the cheap route too, ~4× under Large 2).
- `together` → Together AI serverless (US) *does* host Mistral Large 3 — use for US residency / one
  fewer bill; set `grid_gco2_per_kwh≈400` + Together's rates. (Fireworks only has it on-demand —
  i.e. rent a dedicated GPU — not worth it for a chat bot.)
- `self_hosted` → Apache-2.0 weights, but Large 3 is 675B (multi-GPU). For single-GPU, self-host a
  smaller Mistral (Ministral 3B/8B/14B, Magistral Small 24B); reuse DeepSeek's `local` cost mode.

#### Phase 4 — Slack platform abstraction — *TODO, the big remaining chunk*
Introduce a `ChatPlatform` protocol; make `ClaudeBot`/`ConversationManager` depend on it instead
of `discord.py` directly. Extract `DiscordAdapter` (wrap existing logic, don't rewrite behavior);
build `SlackAdapter` on `slack_bolt` in **Socket Mode** (no public URL). Specifics:
- Threads → `thread_ts`; 👍/👎 calibration → `reaction_added`/`reaction_removed`; files →
  `files_upload_v2`; `!Codex`-style commands → slash commands or `app_mention` parse.
- **Re-key persistence** `memories.json` on `(platform, team/guild, channel)` + a migration that
  namespaces existing Discord keys under `discord:<guild>` (else Discord/Slack clobber each other).
- **Formatting:** Slack is mrkdwn + Block Kit, not Markdown — audit every emit (code fences, bold,
  links, `!help` tables). LaTeX→PNG and the TTS MP3 paths are fine (image/file upload).
- **De-dupe** Slack's event retries on `event_id`/`client_msg_id`.
- Ship a Slack app manifest (scopes + event subs + slash commands). Tokens: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
  (`xoxb-`), `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (`xapp-`).
- This is where the **ISAIC naming skin** activates (Slack = lab bot).

#### Phase 5 — Hermes delegation bridge — *optional, lab-only*
Co-located Hermes Agent (separate service, thin bridge — do NOT merge codebases). Route `!research`
or a new `/task` to a local Hermes instance, stream the trajectory back via existing `send_text`/
`send_file`. **Egress discipline is a security rule, not a convenience:** force Hermes onto the same
hardened endpoints (Fireworks US/ZDR, self-hosted DeepSeek, Vertex); gate genuinely patentable
prompts to self-hosted only. Optional cron delivery into the lab channel. Hydra must still run
fully with Hermes absent.
**2026-07 framework update** (full revision in spec §10): **Hermes Cloud** (Nous-hosted agents on
Nous Portal, 2026-07-08) is explicitly NOT the lab route — it moves the agent runtime (memory,
trajectories, prompts) onto Nous infra, and default onboarding now funnels to Portal (OAuth +
Portal inference + Tool Gateway). Phase 5 = self-hosted Hermes with hand-set provider config;
treat Portal/Cloud opt-ins as egress surface. **v0.18.0** (2026-07-01) meanwhile strengthens the
bridge: Vertex is now a first-class Hermes provider (ADC OAuth, no static key — same GCP prereq
as Hydra's Phase 2 backend), so all three hardened endpoints are natively supported; cron gained
native Slack (Block Kit) + Discord delivery (seam 2 is now mostly configuration) and blocks
`base_url` overrides; the `llm.oneshot` gateway RPC is a concrete seam-1 hand-off surface. MoA
virtual models (panel→aggregator ≈ `!research`+judge) and `/learn` (skills from directories/URLs)
are useful but token-hungry / egress-sensitive — the hardened-endpoint rule extends to whatever
they read. **v0.19.0 "Quicksilver"** (2026-07-20; full entry in spec §10) strengthens the bridge
further: Fireworks is now a first-class Hermes provider (the US/ZDR default no longer rides the
generic OpenAI-compatible path); providers can be hard-disabled (`enabled: false` /
`excluded_providers` — turn Portal/OpenRouter off outright); cron delivery is durable
(delivery-obligation ledger survives gateway crashes); delegation gained unified concurrency caps
(`max_async_children` deprecated); MoA got cost caps (`reference_max_tokens`, per-turn fanout
cadence). ⚠️ New caveat: an `api_content` sidecar persists exact API bytes on local disk — disk
encryption/retention on the Hermes host joins the egress surface. The Portal/Cloud funnel
meanwhile deepened (desktop Cloud connection mode, in-terminal billing, Portal usage tags on
aux/MoA/delegate calls), confirming the self-host ruling; v0.19.1 (2026-07-30) is a bug-fix wave.
Spec §10.5 (new) collects principles borrowed from Anima Labs' Connectome for Phases
4/7 + memory; Connectome itself is research-grade, not a dependency.

#### Phase 7 — Simulator mode (§9, rung 1) — *✅ code-complete, ⚠️ unverified (2026-06-27)*
A second **generation mode** behind the same dispatch (NOT a second bot): `completions_mode=True`
routes a provider to `_generate_simulator_response()` (transcript completion) instead of the chat
path. The whole feature is three methods (§9.3): `_format_transcript` renders channel history as a
`<speaker> body` IRC log (user turns carry `Name:`, bot turns `[Model]`; a leading `[replying to …]`
block is dropped at the block level so embedded `]`/newlines can't corrupt the speaker line) + a
dangling `<Dummy>` continuation cue; `client.completions.create` continues it; `_parse_transcript_turn`
cuts back to one line (server `stop` + a client-side `<name>`-only cut — deliberately NOT `[name]`,
which would eat code/citation lines). `SIM_PROVIDER` ("Dummy"/"Dummy Plug", `id="sim"`) ships
`enabled=False` + `api_key_env=""` (self-hosted, keyless), so the registry leaves it OFF unless
config opts in — the one place `config_enabled` now defaults to the constant's `enabled` instead of
`True` (a no-op for the 6 always-on heads). **Override-only** is enforced in `_select_model`
(`auto_pool` drops `completions_mode`), with one deliberate exception documented in code: if the
base model is the *only* enabled provider (a sim-only box), plain messages route to it via the
`len(enabled)==1` shortcut. Sampler knobs (§9.3) split standard params (on the call) vs
`top_k`/`min_p`/`top_a`/`repetition_penalty` (in `extra_body`); unknown `providers.sim.sampler` keys
warn at startup. ⚠️ **OWES A LIVE SMOKE TEST** — stand up any `/completions` base model (a small
GGUF/Ministral base on vLLM or llama.cpp suffices — no 405B), set
`providers.sim = {enabled:true, base_url, model}`, then `!dummy <prompt>`; confirm the `[Dummy]`
turn lands in `!cost` with tokens + 🌱. **Query-driven search grounding** (§9.2/§9.5) is now wired
behind `providers.sim.search=true` (off by default): `_sim_search_query` detects a `[search: …]`
directive or a leading-question/lookup cue and `_generate_simulator_response` prepends the
`_search_for` snippets to the preamble (gated on `_search_backend_available` so no sentinel leaks).
Rungs 2–3 (ambient turn-taking, webhook personas) and any Phase 4 / lab-adjacent simulator work are
intentionally out of scope.

### Cross-cutting follow-ups
- Verify **pricing**: Fireworks for `qwen3p7-plus` / `glm-5p2` (confirmed live 2026-06), and
  `console.mistral.ai` for `mistral-large-latest` (updated 2026-06 to Large 3 = $0.50/$1.50; reconfirm
  against the console). The **energy** constants (`est_wh_per_1k_tokens`, `train_tco2e`) are
  order-of-magnitude (Mistral `train_tco2e` is still the Large-2 LCA — Large-3's isn't published).
- Live smoke tests still owed: `!mari`/`!rei`/`!asuka` round-trips, `!french bonjour` (Azure
  fr-FR synth) and `!french how do you say …` (Mistral G2P), inline `[[french:..]]`. **Plus the
  new backends (Phase 2/3):** Gemini `vertex` (GCP ADC + `google-cloud-aiplatform`); DeepSeek
  `fireworks` (`!deepseek`) + `self_hosted` (local vLLM → shows `local` in `!cost`); Mistral
  `together` (Together key) + `self_hosted`. Verify the Together Mistral-Large-3 slug + Fireworks
  DeepSeek/Together pricing (flagged `VERIFY`).
- **Phase 7 simulator:** `!dummy <prompt>` against a real `/completions` base endpoint (transcript
  continuation, tokens + carbon in `!cost`); `SIM_PROVIDER` pricing/energy are `VERIFY` placeholders.
  Also smoke-test search grounding: `providers.sim.search=true` + a Tavily key, then a `!dummy`
  turn whose latest line is a question / `[search: …]` — confirm the snippets land in the preamble.
- Operator: keep Fireworks prepaid balance topped up (auto-reload) and Gemini billing current.
